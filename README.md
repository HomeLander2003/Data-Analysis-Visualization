Code processes a heart attack dataset using an OOP-based ETL pipeline. LoadFile reads the CSV file, CleanFile handles missing values, removes duplicates, and drops specific columns, SaveFile exports the cleaned data, AnalyzeFile extracts insights using groupby operations, and VisualizeFile generates pie charts and bar plots with Seaborn and Matplotlib. It also includes logging and error handling to ensure smooth execution and better debugging.
